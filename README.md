#What is Overview?

**Overview** is a tool for analyzing large sets of documents, which includes a sophisticated search engine, word clouds, entity detection, and topic-based document clustering. You can also write your own plugins in an Application Program Interface OR  [API](http://techterms.com/definition/api) for short. It is open source program that you can run on your machine.
It was designed for investigative journalists; however, it is also used in qualitative research, social media conversation analysis, legal document review, digital humanities, etc, and so on. I can see it being used to analize a large corpus of literary texts.

Just sign up for an account, it is that easy. You can download it to your machine, I have not as of yet. 

###History

**Overview** was developed by The Associated Press, and is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation as part of its Knight News Challenge. It has received further support from Google Ideas.
November 2010: was the start of the project through research and design, and moved to proof-of-concept to a working prototype, and now an easy-to-use web application.

###The Nitty Gritty

What **Overview** is a way to file and keep track of plain text documents. No converstion to PDF or other such programs, just upload any text document. 

Overview has so many options:

•	Exhaustive reading, tagging, and metadata entry or review.

•	Convert bulk documents between formats, export only a subset, etc.

•**Overview** includes, Word Clouds, and Entity Detection, as well as a simple folder view. 

Here is an example of **Overview's Word Cloud**, which I developed using [Walt Whitman's](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/walt-whitman) poem [Song of Myself](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182373").

Cool isn't it? As in any **Word Cloud**, the larger words are the most frequently used words in the text. 

There are many features, one fine feature is the abilty to take our useless words, such as adjectives.  As you can see here:

Just hit the erase button and use the cusror to click out the words you do not want. 
It also keeps track of the hidden word, and you click on hidden words, and voila, you can put them back into the cloud. 

Here is an example of the **Xperimental Word Occurance** of the same sample poem by Whitman.

Interesting way to see what words are in a text and how they connect to each other. 

In the **Word Tree** I added in another American Transcendentalist. [Henry David Thoreau's](https://www.walden.org/Thoreau) [Walking](http://thoreau.eserver.org/walking.html) between **Walking** and **Whitman's Song of Myself** We get to see various similar words between the two texts that are now in  the files viewed here.

I am just starting to play with **Overview** so I do not have many files upoaded to the site, but I have given you a bit to show you what it can do. 

###Key Board Short Cuts
**Overview** has several keyboard shortcuts to make navigating through your documents even faster:

•	j, k — view next and previous document in the list.

•	arrow keys — navigate through tree. Selects parent, child, and sibling folders. Or in may case man, transcendentalist, and woods. 

•	u — go back to document list, when viewing a single document.

Both of these sets of keys are essential for rapid review. You can select a folder, press jto read the first document (which automatically switches from the document list to the single document view) and then press right arrow to go to the next folder in the tree.
