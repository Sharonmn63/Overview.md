#What is Overview?

Overview is a tool for analyzing large sets of documents, which includes a sophisticated search engine, word clouds, entity detection, and topic-based document clustering. You can also write your own plugins using the API. It is open source and you can run it on your own computer.
It was designed for investigative journalists; however, it is used in qualitative research, social media conversation analysis, legal document review, digital humanities, etc, and so on.
