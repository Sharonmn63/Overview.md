#What is **Overview**?

Overview is a tool for analyzing large sets of documents, which includes a sophisticated search engine, word clouds, entity detection, and topic-based document clustering. You can also write your own plugins in an Application Program Interface OR [API](http://techterms.com/definition/api)for short. It is open source and you can run it on your own computer.
It was designed for investigative journalists; however, it is also used in qualitative research, social media conversation analysis, legal document review, digital humanities, etc, and so on.

Where to get [Overview](https://www.overviewdocs.com/)

What **Overview**is a way to file plain text documuents. No converstion to PDF or other such programs. 

Overview has so many options:

+Searches for  specific things using a search engine, visualizations, entity detection, etc.

+Exhaustive reading, tagging, and metadata entry or review.

+Convert bulk documents between formats, export only a subset, etc.

Overview includes, word clouds, and entity detection, as well as a regular old folder view. 

Here is an example of **Overview's Word Cloud**, I developed using [Walt Whitman's](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/walt-whitman) poem [Song of Myself](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182373").

Cool isn't it? As in any **word cloud** the larger words are the ones most frequently used words in the text. 

Here is an example of the **xperimental word occurance** of the same sample poem by Whitman.

In the **Word Tree** I added in another American Transcendentalist. [Henry David Thoreau's](https://www.walden.org/Thoreau) [Walking](http://thoreau.eserver.org/walking.html) between **Walking** and **Whitman's Song of Myself** We get to see various similar words between the two texts that are now in files.
